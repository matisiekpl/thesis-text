    abstract = "{Biomedical applications of deep learning algorithms rely on large expert annotated data sets. The classification of bone marrow (BM) cell cytomorphology, an important cornerstone of hematological diagnosis, is still done manually thousands of times every day because of a lack of data sets and trained models. We applied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to a large data set of 171 374 microscopic cytological images taken from BM smears from 945 patients diagnosed with a variety of hematological diseases. The data set is the largest expert-annotated pool of BM cytology images available in the literature. It allows us to train high-quality classifiers of leukocyte cytomorphology that identify a wide range of diagnostically relevant cell species with high precision and recall. Our CNNs outcompete previous feature-based approaches and provide a proof-of-concept for the classification problem of single BM cells. This study is a step toward automated evaluation of BM cell morphology using state-of-the-art image-classification algorithms. The underlying data set represents an educational resource, as well as a reference for future artificial intelligence–based approaches to BM cytomorphology.}",
